# Defining the interview state object

question = """
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    You can return the answer in any order.

    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

expectedApproach = "A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (targetâˆ’nums[i]) exists in the hash table. If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself!"
