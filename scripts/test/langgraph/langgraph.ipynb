      "\"Great! Now that we’ve covered introductions, let’s dive into a data structures and algorithms question. \n",

      "To clarify a few points: \n",

      "1. You can assume that there is exactly one solution for each input.\n",

      "   - There is exactly one solution for each input, so you don’t need to handle cases where no solution exists.\n",
      "   - You cannot use the same element twice, meaning the two indices must point to different elements in the array.\n",
      "   - The order of the indices in your output does not matter; for example, returning `[1, 0]` is also valid if the correct indices are `0` and `1`.\n",
